## About this repository
This repository is a project I created to implement an automated targeting system that can be used for stuff like turrets in games, I guess.
<br><br>This system can:
- Slowly aim at its target
- Calculate the aim point needed to hit a moving target (without considering projectile gravity)
- Calculate the aim point to hit a stationary target (taking projectile gravity into account)
</br>
</br>
  Additionally, the project includes a control panel to adjust various settings of the testing stand.
